        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>
            c-pro 3 OEM is a range of programmable controllers in 8-DIN modules,
            open-board or with housing (blind or with built-in LCD display).
            It has numerous inputs and outputs (up to 21) and an enhanced memory
            capacity to meet the management needs
            of the HVAC/R sector and OEM companies in particular.
            The models with Pulse outputs, for example, can be
            used to control multiplexed cabinets.
            Thanks to the INTRABUS protocol, advantageous point-to-point solutions can be used, including the
            possibility of connecting to remote LED (Vled 3) or LCD (EVJ LCD) user interfaces. The CAN protocol makes it
            possible to increase the number of c-pro 3 OEM inputs/outputs by adding an expansion and to be integrated
            with the entire range of c-pro 3 controllers and displays. The MODBUS RTU option, used with an external
            interface, is always available in both master and slave modes. Those models supplied with the RS-485 enable
            two MODBUS protocols to be used at the same time.
            The application software can be designed in a simple, intuitive and portable way thanks to the UNI-PRO 3
            integrated development environment. The USB port, supplied as standard, makes the controller easy to program
            in the development phase and in debugging and it can be updated using the most common USB flash drives.</p>
